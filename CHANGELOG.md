## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### 🎉 **MAJOR UPDATE: Client-Side Only Architecture**

**💡 Breaking Changes - Simplified & Cost-Effective**

This version completely removes all server-side dependencies, making ReCAPTZ a purely client-side library. This change significantly reduces complexity, eliminates server maintenance costs, and makes the package much more lightweight and easier to use.

**🚀 What's New**

- **Pure Client-Side**: No more server dependencies or costs
- **Lightweight**: Significantly reduced bundle size
- **Simplified API**: Cleaner, more straightforward implementation
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box without any setup
- **Better Performance**: Faster initialization and validation
- **Offline Support**: Works completely offline

**🔧 Improvements**

- **Removed Server Dependencies**: No more ReCAPTZClient, modeManager, or server communication
- **Simplified Types**: Cleaner TypeScript definitions focused on client-side usage
- **Updated Hooks**: All hooks now work synchronously for better performance
- **Streamlined Context**: CaptchaContext is now purely client-side
- **Better Error Handling**: Simplified error management without network concerns

**💔 Breaking Changes**

- **Removed Server Mode**: `configureReCAPTZ` API no longer available
- **Synchronous Validation**: `validate()` and `refresh()` are now synchronous
- **No Session Tokens**: Server-side session management removed
- **Simplified Audio**: Audio now uses only Web Speech API
- **Updated Hook Returns**: Removed Promise returns from validation hooks

**📦 Migration Guide**

```tsx
// Old (v1.x) - Server/Client mode
import { configureReCAPTZ } from "recaptz";
configureReCAPTZ.setMode("server", "https://api.example.com");

// New (v2.x) - Client-only (no configuration needed)
import { Captcha } from "recaptz";
// Just use it directly!

// Old async validation
const isValid = await validate();

// New sync validation
const isValid = validate();
```

**🎯 Why This Change?**

- **Cost Reduction**: No server infrastructure to maintain
- **Simplicity**: Easier to use and integrate
- **Reliability**: No network dependencies
- **Performance**: Faster with no API calls
- **Scalability**: Pure client-side scales infinitely
